This is a fork of [react-slidedown]() with zero code change but just [a package](https://github.com/xavierraffin/react-slidedown/packages/617417) ready to install.

To install the package you can do:

```sh
npm install @xavierraffin/react-slidedown@2.4.6 --save
```

The package is hosted on Github package and not npm, so you'll have to have a `.npmrc` like this:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
@xavierraffin:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

See this discussion for details: https://github.com/frankwallis/react-slidedown/issues/37
